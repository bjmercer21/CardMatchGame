# CardMatchGame
Click on the cards, remember the color, and find the match


This project was a project in Object Oriented class that we used to learn
  how to set up a GUI using JFrame.  

Using eclipse when this is run, in the console it will ask how many pairs of cards you would like
  to have in this game.  After all of the pairs have been found, in the console it will tell you how many
  clicks it took for you to find all the pairs.
